CCRC collects and processes personal data for the exercise of its own and associated public functions.\r\n\r\n**About personal information **\r\n\r\nPersonal data is information about you as an individual. It can be your name, address or telephone number. It can also include information about criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe know how important it is to protect customers’ privacy and to comply with data protection laws. We will safeguard your personal data and will only disclose it where it is lawful to do so, or with your consent.\r\n\r\n**How we process personal information**\r\n\r\nIf you apply to the CCRC we will use the information you give us, including your personal information, to help us consider your case. This means that we may decide to use the information you give us to get hold of material belonging to other organisations. This could be information about you or about any other person or subject if we think it could have an impact on your case.\r\n\r\nThe CCRC has special legal powers get any material or information we think we need to investigate a case even if organisations or individuals do not want us to have it. We often obtain case related information from the police, the courts and other organisations and agencies such as the NHS and social services. Once we have started looking into a case we will decide what material we need.\r\n\r\nWe are aware of how sensitive the information involved in our investigations can be. We always take great care of the information that we get when looking into cases. We try to obtain only what we need, and we aim to keep the information only for as long as is reasonable in the case.\r\n\r\nWe are very careful about how and when we share information relating to cases and do so only when it is allowed by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.\r\n\r\nWhen a case is referred by the CCRC for an appeal, the information relevant to the appeal is usually shared with the applicant in the case, the appeal court and the prosecution. When a case is referred for appeal we will usually issue a brief press release about the reasons the case is being referred. We may also share information about the applicant with the Miscarriage of Justice Support Service which is a not-for-profit organisation that offers help to people who have been wrongly convicted.",
