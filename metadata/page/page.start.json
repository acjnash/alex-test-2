We have to find something new and important to send your case for a fresh appeal\r\n\r\nThe CCRCâ€™s job is to look at your case independently.  This means that we do not act as your lawyer.  It also means we are independent of the police the prosecution and the courts.\r\n\r\nIt costs nothing to make an application to the CCRC and your sentence cannot be increased if we send your case for appeal.\r\n\r\nIn this CCRC application we ask for information about you to help us look at your case.  We may also decide to use what you tell us in this application to help us get hold of other information about your case.\r\n\r\nPlease try to fill in s much of the application as you can, but do not worry if you cannot answer some of the questions.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us if there is anything that you do not understand:\r\n\r\nTelephone: 0121 233 1473\r\nLocal rate number for prisoners: 0300 456 2699\r\nEmail: info@ccrc.gov.uk",
