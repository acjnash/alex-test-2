We have to find something new and important to send your case for a fresh appeal.\r\n\r\nThe CCRC's job is to look at your case independently. This means we do not act as your lawyer. It also means we are independent of the police, the prosecution, and the courts. \r\n\r\nIt costs nothing to make an application to the CCRC and your sentence cannot be increased if we send your case for appeal.\r\n\r\nIf you're not sure about any of your answers don't worry. Please provide the best information you can and we will double check when you submit your application",
